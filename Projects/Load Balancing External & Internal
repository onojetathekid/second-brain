Load Balancer function is to distributes user traffic across
multiple instances of application. distributes across 5 nodes for example
all traffic via LB and manage load especially during heavy traffic periods

- Load Balancing reduce rick app get overburdened
- CLB serve content close as possible to the users of the system.
- CLB is a Global entity, trying to serve europe traffic to europe servers
- CLB is fully distributed, software defined, logical network entity.
- LB coupled with IG to support HA environment and Auto Scaling.
-
Types of LB;
External -
-used to get internet traffic in and out of your VPC.
-communicate over 2 vpc networks need External LB
-any external communication from VPC to external networks or internet
    *Global - backends distributed across multiple Regions
      -http/https
      -ssl Proxy
      -tcp proxy
    *Regional - backends are in 1 region
      -network
- Get traffic from the internet into GCCPC network

Internal - distributes traffic from internal GCP regional

      -UDP traffic
        Internal TCP/UDP LB handles all TCP/UDP Traffic for V
      -Http/Https Traffic
        Internal HTTP(S) LB - all calls for internally for VPC

** External traffic **

HTTP/HTTPS LB - Most Used & Most Powerful LB In GC - Application OSI Layer


HTTP(S) load balancer is external GLOBAL Load balancer
