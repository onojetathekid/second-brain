HTTP(S) Load Balancer:
***Forwarding Rule - It specifies an external IP address, port, and global target
    HTTP(S) proxy.
        - Clients (Browser) use the IP address and port to connect to the load
          balancer.
        - Each forwarding rule provides a single IP address that can be used in DNS
          records for your application.
        - The forwarding rule for an HTTP load balancer can only reference TCP ports
          80 and 8080.
        - The forwarding rule for an HTTPS load balancer can only reference TCP port
        443.
        - Type of forwarding rule required by external HTTP(S) load balancers
          depends on which Network Service Tier.
            NST:(Forwarding rule)
            * Premium Tier : Highest performance: Traffic between the internet and VM
              instances in your VPC network is routed by keeping it within Google's network as
              much as possible.
              - For services that need global availability.
              - Unique to Google Cloud, cannot create duplicate of redundant
              - Premium Tier is the default NST.
              - Standard Tier - Cost optimized: Traffic between the internet and VM instances in
                your VPC network is routed over the internet in general.
            * Standard Tier: Cost optimized: Traffic between the internet and VM instances in
              your VPC network is routed over the internet in general. Not the fastest, routed
              over the internet in general. Delays are possible.
              -For services hosted entirely within a region.
              -Performance is comparable to other Cloud providers.
              -HTTP(S) load balancers in the Standard Tier use regional external forwarding
                rules.
***** Target Proxy - It receives a request from the client. Client>>DNS Server>>
        Serves Forwarding Rule/LB IP>>Target proxy.
        -It evaluates the request by using the URL map to make traffic routing
          decisions.
        - Proxy can also authenticate communications by using SSL
          certificates. Verify SSL then Forward
        - If user is using HTTPS load balancing, the target proxy uses global
          SSL certificates to prove its identity to clients.
        - HTTP(S) proxy uses a global URL map to make a routing
          determination based on HTTP attributes such as the request path,
          cookies, or headers.
        - The URL map can specify additional actions, such as sending
          redirects to clients.

***** URL Map - When a request arrives at the load balancer, the load balancer routes
      the request to a particular backend service or backend bucket based on
      configurations in a URL map.
      - URL map lets you set up this type of host and path-based routing.
      different services to different machines.
      - Each URL map has a name.
      - URL map has the same name as the name of the load balancer.
      - URL Map has two components, Host name and path.

***Example Beg****

http://example.net/video/hd
Host - example.net
Path - /video/hd

 FWd Rule>>Target HTTP(s) Proxy>>Host Rule>>Path Matcher>>Path rule>>Backend Service>>
                Instance Groups/Network Endpoint Groups(NEGs)

***Example End****

***** Backend Services - It distributes requests to healthy backends
        (instance groups containing Compute Engine VMs, GKE containers),
        or Cloud Storage buckets.
        - One or more backends must be connected to the backend service.
        - Backend service can be either instance groups or network endpoint
          groups (NEGs), but not a combination of both.
        - User can enable connection draining on backend services to ensure
          minimal interruption to your users when an instance that is serving
          traffic is terminated, removed manually, or removed by an autoscaler
        - Changes to a backend service associated with an external HTTP(S)
          load balancer are not instantaneous. It can take several minutes for
          changes to propagate throughout the network.


***** Session Affinity - Itâ€™s a best-effort attempt to send requests
          from a particular client to the same backend for as long as the
          backend is healthy
          - Google Cloud HTTP(S) Load Balancing offers three types of
          session affinity:
                - NONE. Session affinity is not set for the load balancer.
                - Client IP affinity sends requests from the same client IP
                address to the same backend.
                - Generated cookie affinity sets a client cookie when the first
                request is made, and then sends requests with that cookie to
                the same backend.
